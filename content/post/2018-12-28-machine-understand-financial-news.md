Machine Reads Financial News
==================================

This article talks about a BERT model I trained to understand financial news. Particularly, we fine-tuned a pretrained BERT model to generate embedding vector given a financial news dataset I collected by web-crawler. I will also demonstrate how to use the learned embedding vector to query similar news in history.

coming soon...
